# Remote Access

## Setup a Virtual Private Server (VPS)

To remotely access a server, it must be internet-accessible, typically via a static IP. For servers with dynamic IPs, a dynamic DNS service can map the IP to a hostname. If dynamic DNS isn’t feasible (e.g., due to restricted router access preventing port forwarding), a VPS (e.g., from Google, Linode, Oracle) with a static IP can be used to establish a reverse VPN tunnel, enabling secure remote access.
